This code demonstrates how to integrate LangChain-OpenAI into a Microsoft Fabric Notebook with PySpark, leveraging a Lakehouse to store and query data. This setup allows us to turn natural language questions into complex SQL queries seamlessly.\n","\n","**Note:** Attach a Lakehouse with your tables to this Notebook, previous to
